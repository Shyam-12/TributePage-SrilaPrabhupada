          Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami (Abhaya Caraṇāravinda
          Bhakti-vedānta Svāmī; 1 September 1896 – 14 November 1977) or Srila
          Prabhupada, born Abhay Charan De, was an Indian spiritual teacher and
          the founder-acharya (preceptor) of the International Society for
          Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), commonly known as the "Hare Krishna
          movement". Members of the ISKCON movement view Bhaktivedanta Swami as
          a representative and messenger of Krishna Chaitanya. <br />
          <br />He has been described as a charismatic leader who was successful
          in acquiring followers in many countries including the United States,
          Europe and India. His mission was to propagate throughout the world
          Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a school of Vaishnavite Hinduism that had been
          taught to him by his guru, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. After his
          disappearence in 1977, ISKCON, the society he founded based on using
          the Bhagavata Purana as a central scripture, continued to grow. In
          February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported reaching a milestone of
          distributing over half a billion of his books since 1965. His
          translation of and commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, titled
          Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, is considered by ISKCON adherents and many
          Vedic scholars as the finest, bona fide translation of Vaishnava
          literary works.

        <!-- <h1>Early life</h1> -->
        <p>
          Srila Prabhupada was born into a Vaisnava family on 1 September 1896
          in Calcutta, India. His parents named him Abhay Charan De (one who is
          fearless, having taken shelter at Lord Krishna‘s feet.) He graduated
          from the prestigious Scottish Church College in 1920, with majors in
          English, philosophy and economics. However, in a display of solidarity
          with Gandhi’s independence movement against British rule in India, he
          refused to accept his diploma.

        <!-- <h1>Mission to the West</h1> -->
        <p>
          In 1922 he met his spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
          Thakura, a prominent scholar in the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition.
          Bhaktisiddhanta requested that he spread the ancient knowledge of the
          Vedas in English to the Western countries. Srila Prabhupada was
          already married and running a small pharmaceutical business at that
          time. His wife was pious and devoted to Lord Krishna, but didn’t share
          his enthusiasm for preaching and writing about the philosophy. In the
          following years Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita,
          and in 1944 started Back to Godhead, an English fortnightly magazine
          still published today by his disciples. In 1947 the Gaudiya Vaisnava
          Society recognized his scholarship and honored him with the title
          “Bhaktivedanta” (one who has realized that devotional service to the
          Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge.) <br />
          In 1954 Srila Prabhupada retired from family life and entered
          vanaprastha, dedicating himself completely to writing and studying the
          Vaisnava classic literatures. He set up residence in Vrindavan, the
          birthplace of Lord Krishna. In 1959 he accepted sannyasa, the
          renounced order, and began his life’s opus: translating and writing
          commentary on the Srimad-Bhagavatam. With beginning the translation of
          the Bhagavatam from Sanskrit to English, Prabhupada was preparing to
          fulfill his spiritual master’s order to preach in the West.

          in 1965 at the age of sixty-nine, he left his homeland on a freight
          ship bound for the United States of America. He was finally on his way
          to fulfill his master’s desire to distribute bhakti yoga (the practice
          of devotion to the Lord) outside the borders of India. While on board
          the ship, he survived two heart attacks. When he arrived in New York
          City, he had about seven dollars (in Indian rupees) and his precious
          books. In the beginning, life for Srila Prabhupada in New York City
          was not easy, but slowly his spiritual message reached many young
          people. He chanted the Hare Krishna maha-mantra in Tompkins Square
          Park and gave lessons on the Bhagavad-gita at the Lower East Side
          Matchless Gift Shop, where Satsvarupa Goswami first met him. Krishna
          was providing potency, and after only one year, Srila Prabhupada was
          able to register the International Society for Krishna Consciousness
          (ISKCON) as a society. It was the beginning of the spiritual
          revolution in the West that Srila Prabhupada had already envisaged.

          Prabhupada had an extraordinary capacity to preach according to the
          mentality and culture of the people he was dealing with. He was a wise
          innovator and empowered his students to teach Krishna consciousness
          using different approaches: public singing (kirtan), book
          distribution, university lectures, festivals, food relief programs,
          establishing temples, developing rural farm communities to protect
          animals, commissioning new drawings to skilled artists – he was
          tireless in his efforts. If a preaching strategy was not effective
          enough by Prabhupada’s standards, Prabhupada and his disciples would
          explore new possibilities until they got the results Prabhupada
          wanted. Disciples were energized by Prabhupada’s strength and vision,
          and found they were capable of doing things they would never have
          imagined they could do – like running temples, writing articles and
          books on Vaisnava philosophy, or even teaching in countries far away
          from home.

          In the twelve years that Prabhupada was with us – from the time he
          arrived in America in 1965 until his departure from this world in 1977
          – this charismatic spiritual pioneer developed a resume of incredible
          successes: he founded a Vaisnava society in the West, ISKCON, which
          grew into a worldwide confederation of hundreds of temples, centers,
          educational institutions and farm communities; so successful was
          Prabhupada’s mission that it eventually spread from the West back to
          the East, resurging in the Indian holy towns of Vrindavan and Mayapur;
          he published English translations and commentaries of numerous sacred
          texts (most available on line), such as the Bhagavad-gita As It Is,
          Srimad-Bhagavatam and Sri Caitanya-caritamrta; many of Prabhupada’s
          books have been translated into different languages and are highly
          appreciated by the academic community for their fidelity and simple
          clarity of presentation (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust); he circled the
          globe fourteen times while teaching spiritual knowledge to a diverse
          populace; he initiated thousands of disciples and interacted
          comfortably with important personalities; he strongly supported
          vegetarianism as a basic principle of life and began the ISKCON Food
          Relief Program (now called Food for Life.) In 1977, at the age of 81,
          Prabhupada left this world in Vrindavan, India under the loving care
          of his disciples, who continue his worldwide mission. He is still
          present through his books, legacy projects, strong memories and loving
          service of his disciples around the globe. His motto he lived by is
          easy to remember and apply: “Chant and be happy.”
